# Solutions

This page links to solutions to exercises submitted by members of the community. I have not checked them. You are welcome to add a link to your own solutions by submitting a PR.

I personally recommend avoiding the temptation to look at other people's solutions for the most part, since there is a risk that it will prevent you from thinking through the exercise for yourself. However, it can be helpful to look at other people's solutions in certain situations, such as to compare them with your own solutions once you have completed the exercises, or to get a hint if you are stuck. Just take a moment to think about what you are trying to achieve by looking at other people's solutions, and be aware that you will not learn nearly as much by copying someone else's implementation.
