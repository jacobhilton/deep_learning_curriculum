# Solutions

This page links to solutions to exercises submitted by members of the community. I have not checked them. You are welcome to add a link to your own solutions by submitting a PR.

I recommend avoiding the temptation to look at other people's solutions before you have completed the exercise yourself, since you will not learn nearly as much by copying someone else's implementation. However, it can be helpful to compare your solution with other people's once you have completed the exercise, or to take a peek if you are completely stuck.
